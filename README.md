# London Transit Stops
By: Sean Legge

This project takes in user input from a command window, where the user can enter a street name. Once the street name is entered, the input is compared to an XML document containing all of the London Transit stop information. A list of bus stops is returned that are on that street that the user had inputted, along with stop number, route number and latitude and longitude.
